# TODO

## Requirements

Functionality: Essential
- [ ] The backend should expose RESTful endpoints to handle user input and
  return movie ratings.
- [ ] The system should store data in a database. You can use any existing
  dataset or API to populate the initial database.
- [ ] Implement user endpoints to create and view user information.
- [ ] Implement movie endpoints to create and view movie information.
- [ ] Implement a rating system to rate the entertainment value of a movie.
- [ ] Implement a basic profile where users can view their rated movies.
- [ ] Include unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and validation of user inputs.

Functionality: Extra
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for users.
- [ ] Provide documentation for your API endpoints using tools like Swagger.
- [ ] Implement logging to record errors and debug information.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms to improve the rating system's performance.
- [ ] Implement CI/CD quality gates.

Architecture / Docs
- [ ] My only submission is just the code repo, so this project will need to contain everything needed to run the app, including library dependencies and infrastructure.
    * I'll probably want to use something like Docker Compose so that someone else can spin up/down the service, and/or deploy the service live with a basic UI so that reviewers can see it in action.
- [ ] Part of the evaluation is system design, so I will need to document the API endpoints well.
    * I'd also like to include a discussion of changes I might make for different scaling scenarios.
- [ ] Re: Implement CI/CD quality gates, maybe add a Python linter from the beginning? Reference a style guide?


## Submitting the project
- [X] Fork this GitHub repository.
- [ ] Commit your code regularly with meaningful commit messages.
- [ ] Include/Update the README.md file explaining how to set up and run your
  backend, including any dependencies.
- [ ] Submit the link to your repository.
